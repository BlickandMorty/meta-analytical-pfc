"""
TESTS FOR META-ANALYTICAL PFC
==============================

Test suite to make sure everything is working.

Think of this like:
- Going to the doctor for a checkup
- The doctor runs tests to make sure you're healthy
- We run tests to make sure our AI system is working

When you make changes to the code, run the tests to make sure
you didn't break anything!

How to run tests:
    python -m pytest tests/ -v

Or run a specific test:
    python -m pytest tests/test_memory.py -v
