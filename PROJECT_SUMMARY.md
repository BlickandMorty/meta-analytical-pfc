# meta-analytical pfc summary

this system answers research questions by chaining multiple reasoning modes, then writing a clear final answer.

## reasoning engines

- statistical analysis
- causal inference
- meta-analysis
- bayesian updating
- adversarial validation

## flow

1) interpret the question
2) run the relevant engines
3) combine evidence
4) output answer + confidence

## observability + control (new)

- Leibnizian conceptual chords (prime + frequency mapping)
- Continued-fraction focus controller (entropy valve)
- Real TDA on local model activations
- Telemetry JSONL stream + live dashboard
- Contextual Allostasis Engine (CAE) safety state machine
- Automated experiment pipeline + reports
- Baseline model comparison + Pythia topology drift + inference benchmark

## useful entry points

- `src/core/adaptive_pfc.py` = main brain
- `run_learning_demo.py` = show self-improvement
- `training/` + `evaluation/` = data + benchmarks
